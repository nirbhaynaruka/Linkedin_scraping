To get the best understanding of an investment, all data points are considered. You’ll bring the data into the business, build the data infrastructure around it and deliver the data to the right person in the business to build their investment models.Tech is also completely flexible.

Picking up new tech will be part of your job.This is a $60 billion plus fund, where being at the cutting edge of technology in general, let alone finance, is key for them. With this amount of ambition, it’s why their bonuses can be some of the biggest in the industry. First year total compensation could be as high as $400,000 and this has the potential to get better year on year, based on your performance.When in the office you have a fully catered canteen with a Michelin standard chef, barista coffee, a gym and more.Want to explore (or to continue exploring) high-tech in the Hedge Fund world?No up-to-date resume required initially, we can work on updating it together if need be before submitting.",,,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3886268515&keywords=data%20analyst&location=united%20states
